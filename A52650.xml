            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have with too much impatience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the opening of this Campagne, to be any longer deprived of the Account of thoſe proſperous beginnings which have already ſignalized it, wherein the Succeſs of the King hath evidenced and aſſerted the Juſtice of his Arms. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Hiſtorians muſt acknowledge they are obliged to a more then ordinary diligence, to be able to keep pace with that ſwift courſe of Victory that attends his Majeſty. We ſcarce had heard, that this glorious Monarch was preparing to undertake an action of the higheſt reputation to his deſigns, but that we were immediately told he had gone through with it, with all the advantage imaginable; but I fear I do too long provoke your appetite, it is now time to ſatisfie it. I ſhall enter upon the matter with the particulars of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of a conſiderable part of the Garriſon of <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> which was but a praeludium to the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Vicount <hi>de Turenne</hi> (being arrived the Twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> with a Body of Horſe, at a ſmall Place ſcituate upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> within a League of <hi>Keiſerwart,</hi> belonging to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> which they began to fortifie towards the River) went to ſee part of the Kings Troops, to the number of 10000 Men, who lay intrenched near the Head of a great Bridge of Boats which they had fitted up in that Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides another built over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which is of a particular make, and is defended by a Floating Redoubt, that bears both Men and Artillery.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56897:3"/>
            <p>After having well viewed theſe Troops, which he found in excellent order, he appointed the Count <hi>Montal</hi> (that commanded them) to go the next night and diſcover the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in order to the Armies marching ſecurely by <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> and <hi>Burick,</hi> up to <hi>Weſel.</hi> The Count ſet out to execute this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with 200 Horſe, belonging to His Majeſties Guards, under the Command of the Sieur <hi>Mombrun,</hi> Captain Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the ſecond Company of the Kings Muskettiers, with the like number of Light-Horſmen under the Command of the Marqueſs of S. <hi>Gelais,</hi> Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> and Thirty Dragoons.</p>
            <p>After having marched all night, he arrived next morning by break of day at <hi>Abbaye de Camp,</hi> within a League of <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> where he heard, That the Garriſon of that Town went out very often to cut Wood, in the adjoyning Foreſt which belongs to the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> for the making of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſadoes, and deſiring to make his advantage of it for the Kings ſervice, he reſolved to lay an Ambuſh for them about a League and an half from the Abbey. To that end, he went to a place which was ſhewed him by his Guides, but not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that convenient, he would chuſe one nearer to <hi>Rhineberg:</hi> ſo leaving his Troops there, he onely took with him three of the Guard, as many Muskettiers, and ſix Dragoons, with whom were the ſaid Sieur <hi>de Mombrun</hi> the Count <hi>de Druy,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Bethune;</hi> theſe two ſerving as Adjutants, and the Sieur <hi>de Bois</hi> aid Major of <hi>Charle Roy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come into a cloſe Road, he diſcovered 150 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiers which came from <hi>Rhineberg;</hi> whereupon (Fortune ſeeming ſo to favor his Deſign) he ſent back the ſaid Sieur <hi>de Mombrun</hi> in all haſt to his Troops, to bring him a 100 Horſmen and the Dragoons, hiding himſelf in the mean while from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen. But the Enemy continuing their march on that ſide where he was, he commanded the three Muskettiers and ſix Dragoons that were with him to light off their Horſes, and go in to a Ditch, hard by the way. But the Vantguard of the enemy, which marched near fifty paces diſtance from their Body, perceiving them, and crying out, <hi>Who are you for?</hi> they fired at them.</p>
            <p>The Enemy immediately filled all the way, and diſcovered the Count of <hi>Montal,</hi> who was forced to charge them with thoſe few people he had with him, who bravely broke through them, after having received great part of their ſhot, and got between two Hedges very thick, ſet with Buſhes that grow all along on the ſides of the Ditches.</p>
            <p>The noiſe haſtned forward the Sieur <hi>de Mombrun,</hi> with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56897:3"/>Troop of Genſdarms, conſiſting of Fifty Men, who ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> but they (without being any way diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) going into the Ditches, ſhot ſo thick, that he was forced to cauſe all his Dragoons, Genſdarms, and the Kings Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to light off their Horſes.</p>
            <p>The Enemy ſeeing that, and that the other Troop of Light-Horſmen came on, began to think of taking the ſafeſt courſe, which was to retreat croſs a Corn Field, to other Hedges which were yet ſtronger; by the means of which, they might get into <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> not imagining that our people ſhould have been able to paſs a Ditch ten foot deep.</p>
            <p>But Fortune preſented a Paſſage to the Count of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> which he leaped over with his Horſe, being followed but by a few by reaſon of its difficulty; and thoſe that were on foot, getting over in other places, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſaw the way was intercepted, and ſo were forced to return to their old poſt, whence they continued their ſhooting; but were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet upon by thoſe that were on foot, and by the Fifty Light Horſmen, at the Head of which, was the Sieur St. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> and at the ſame time the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> fell upon them in the way, where every one behaved himſelf ſo gallantly, that they came up to one another, till at laſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were forced to call for Quarter, after having had Fifty of their number killed. So the reſt were made Priſoners, the greateſt part of which were wounded, in which number were a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, two Enſigns, a Lieutenant-Colonel, that commanded the party; the Governor of <hi>Rhineberg</hi>'s Son in Law, who was wounded in the Body with two Musket ſhots. The Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> brought them that night to the Camp, where he found the Vicount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> who were extreamly ſatisfied with the ſucceſs they had againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were almoſt equal in number to the Aſſailants, and had beſides an unqueſtionable advantage of the Ground.</p>
            <p>And one may juſtly ſay, That never did Soldiers fight with greater courage then theſe did on this occaſion, as if they had repreſented to themſelves, That it was the firſt exploit of the Campagne, and were thence encouraged to ſignalize in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner their Zeal and Valor. But the Sieur <hi>de Mombrun,</hi> the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Gelays,</hi> the Chevaliers <hi>de Bethune</hi> and <hi>de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillac,</hi> and ſeveral others, were prodigal of their perſons, in imitation of the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> who hath merited the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhare of glory, by his wiſe conduct and forward valor in this Action: Which is ſo much the more memorable, in that there was killed on our ſide but two Private Soldiers, three of the Kings Muskettiers, one <hi>Guarde du Corps</hi> ſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56897:4"/>Horſemen, and three Horſes. There were two Dragoons wounded and the Chevalier <hi>de Marſillac</hi> Cornet of Light-horſe, who was ſhot in the Body with a Piſtol, but if he eſcape, we ſhall obtain a Victory an a very eaſie mate, and teach our Enemies not to dare to venture our while our Troops are abroad. But I ſhall leave this for to give an Account of the Conqueſt of Four Towns, which were almoſt as ſoon taken as attempted. I here ſend you the firſt Advices from the Camp, ſtill expecting the farther particulars.</p>
            <p>The King having reſolved the 30th paſt to form theſe four Sieges, arrived the 2d. Inſtant about Nine in the Morning before <hi>Orſoy;</hi> that day being ſpent in obſerving the Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the place, it was Reſolved, to begin the Siege the night following: Which was put in execution about Ten at Night, according to the Orders of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to whoſe care his Majeſty had committed the Conduct of this Attack, whilſt the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> Beſieged <hi>Weſel,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne Burick,</hi> and the reſt of the Troops <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> whither His Majeſty was gone Himſelf to the Cavalry, Commanded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt that place, and their ſeveral Poſts, afterwards returned to <hi>Orſoy.</hi> It was Order'd to make two Reall, and two Falſe Attacks, the former to be Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Roanez,</hi> Lieutenant-General, the <hi>Chevalier de Lorraine, Maiſtre de Camp,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Beringhen,</hi> Collonell; and the Falſe Attacks to be made by Two Companies of the Kings Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under the Conduct of the Count <hi>de St. Geran,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Mouſſy.</hi> The Aſſault was made with ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and bravery, that they began to lodge their Men at the foot of the Counterſcharpe, the Breach having been made at the head of it.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, who no more ſpares Himſelf, than the leaſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer or Soldier of his Troops, Reſolved, being accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> to obſerve Himſelf the Opening of this Breach, behind a ſmall Battery, to preſerve Him from the Canon of the Enemy, though with ſo little ſecurity, that the <hi>Chevalier d' Arquien</hi> was killed there upon the place.</p>
            <p>As well the Beſiegers as the Beſieged, continued ſhooting very furiouſly all Night; the beſieged not being wanting to make ſome Reſiſtance to favour the Humour of the <hi>French,</hi> to whom no Action ſeems to Merit any Honor that is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with ſome Difficulty.</p>
            <p>About Nine next Morning, Monſieur ſent a Trumpetter with the Count of <hi>Grammont</hi> to Summon the Town, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, he aſſured the Governor, that they could not hold out two dayes longer, and in caſe he deferred to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56897:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Surrender the Place, that all the Garriſon ſhould be put to the Sword, and the Town left to the Pillage of the Soldiers: The ſaid Governor anſwered with all the Courage poſſible, That the <hi>States-General</hi> had not entruſted to him that Poſt, to quit it ſo eaſily. But, notwithſtanding this <hi>Dutch</hi> Bravado, he quickly cooled, and was obliged to ſurrender the Place, upon no other Termes, then that he and his Garriſon ſhould remaine Priſoners of War.</p>
            <p>All thoſe that were employed in this Attack, ſtrove to out-doe each the other in performing wonders; The Count <hi>de Grancé,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de St. Hilaire,</hi> were dangerouſly wounded with Musket-ſhot, the one in the Knee, and the other in the Reines. The <hi>Sieur de Beauviré</hi> Captain in the <hi>Dolphins</hi> Regiment was mortally wounded, the <hi>Count de Valin</hi> was killed, with a Lieutenant, and about Eight common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, there having been onely Five wounded.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Inſtant, the Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who had opened the Trenches before <hi>Buricke</hi> the day before came early in the morning to acquaint His Majeſty with the taking of that Place, on the ſame Conditions that <hi>Orſoy</hi> was; The ſame day the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſent likewiſe to give <hi>His Majeſty</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Surrender of <hi>Weſel</hi> upon the firſt Attack they had made on the Fort on the <hi>Lippe,</hi> not farr from the ſaid Place.</p>
            <p>So that onely <hi>Rhynbergh</hi> remained untaken, where it was reſolved to open the Trenches the next day, at night, but the loſs of theſe three other places had ſo diſheartened the Garriſon of this, that not daring to expect an Attack, they Implored the <hi>Kings Mercy,</hi> who accordingly permitted the Garriſon to draw out the next morning with Drums beating, Colours flying, and with their Baggage, having ordered a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to conduct them to <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Victory and Glory delight to heap their Crowns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of this great Monarch, who with ſo much ardor undergoes the Toiles of the Warr, that the ſeemes to Merit the Favors of the one and the other, having ſubjected under his Power Four Places, in ſo ſmall a time, and with the Loſs onely of 100 Men, who have been killed in theſe Actions.</p>

                  <p>YEſterday before Night I receiv'd the News of the taking of <hi>Groll</hi> by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who Beſieged it in Perſon with the Forces of the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> and his own, Commanded by Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg,</hi> 'tis one of the beſt places the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had, it held out but four dayes. The Prince having given me an Account of the Fords and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that I had ordered him to diſcover along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from <hi>Schenck</hi> as far as <hi>Arnheim;</hi> I paſſed through <hi>Rees</hi> with my <hi>Gensdarmes,</hi> and came into his Camp near <hi>Emmerick</hi> where I ſupp'd; and, as ſoon as I roſe from Table, took b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, after I had given Orders for the drawing out a Thouſand of his Foot, and the Marching of a body of Horſe and Dragoons with ſome Artillery, and the Boats for Tranſportation, and arrived this morning before day. I had with me a Guide that knew exactly all the Fords of this River, upon whoſe Information I Commanded the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to diſcover a part of it over againſt a place called <hi>Tolhuys,</hi> which upon triall he found Fordable. I planted two Batteries upon the Banck of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to play upon them that ſhould offer to oppoſe the Horſe I intended to ſend over on the Right and Left of the Batteries, while I was making a Bridge of <hi>Boats</hi> in the mean time to paſs over the Foot upon; upon the Information brought me by the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> I commanded Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe of the Left Wing to paſs the River under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſaid Count, at the Ford which he had diſcovered over againſt <hi>Tolhuys;</hi> The Regiment of <hi>Cuiraſſiers</hi> was to paſs firſt, of which ten or twelve commanded men to paſs over, ſometimes by Fording it, and ſometimes by Swimming, eſpy'd Three Squadrons advancing towards them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hedges and Willowes, and were at firſt briskly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Officers of the Firſt Squadron, they Drawing back ſome few ſteps in the River, till thoſe that followed to ſecond them could come up, made their way afterwards with their Swords in their hands ſo bravely and reſolutely, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third Squadron (with the fright of it) diſcharged at random in the Air, and ran. The Firſt, which hitherto had ſet a good face upon it, gave back as well as the others to which the continual Fire of our Canon did not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; and now the reſt of the Horſe were all paſſed over at the Ford, one party of them advanced towards the Enemy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56897:6"/>under the Command of the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> and the reſt ſtood in Battalia on the Bank of the River.</p>
                  <p>This Action was accompanyed with all the Succeſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we could deſire, having loſt very few Horſe in the Paſſage. <hi>Nogent</hi> being the onely Perſon of Note that was drowned: But afterwards, as ill Fortune would have it, the Prince, to whom I had ſent, not to paſs the River, was already gone, before my Orders reach'd him, in a ſmall Boat, to ſee what Men we ſhould put into the Caſtle of <hi>Tolhuys,</hi> and to informe himſelf better of what paſſed on the other ſide of the Water; ſo that not knowing any thing of my Deſign, and ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and Duke <hi>de Longueville</hi> advance upon the Spur towards a Barricade, where the Three Squadrons I mention'd before had joyn'd themſelves with ſome other Horſe and Foot, he made all the haſt he could thither, and was follow'd by ſeveral others, who now began to keep no Meaſures, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch an Example.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, the Prince, and thoſe other Gentlemen aſtoniſhed the Enemy with their Threatnings, and their Preſence, and beſides the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> ſurpriſing them in the Reare with ſome Squadrons, had preſſed them ſo cloſe, that they put themſelves in a poſture of yielding, on Condition they might have Fair Quarter; But, Monſieur <hi>de Longueville</hi> having paſſed the Barricade, and crying, Kill, kill, No Quarter; and, as ſome ſay, diſcharged a Piſtoll upon them; out of pure deſpair they made one Volley more, in which the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had the bone of his left Wriſt broken, Monſieur <hi>de Longueville</hi> and <hi>Guitry</hi> were killed upon the Spot, and ſeveral others were killed and wounded, which you will ſee in the following Liſt. If we had had a little patience, not one of thoſe men had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped our hands, the <hi>Comte de Guiche</hi> had begirt them cloſe on one ſide, and ſhould have faln upon them on the other with the other Squadrons, and the Foot which by this time were almoſt all paſſed in their Boats; whereas through our own precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the routing them has coſt us very dear; this excepted, all things are in a very good condition as to the <hi>Bettaw,</hi> and I have much cauſe to praiſe God for the happy Succeſs of this Enterprize, and to promiſe my ſelf great advantages by it.</p>
